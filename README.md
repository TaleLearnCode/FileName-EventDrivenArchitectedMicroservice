# Building an Event-Driven Microservice from Scratch

## Abstract
Event-driven microservice architectures offer a powerful method for designing and integrating complex software systems with independent, encapsulated components. This highly interactive session will start with an empty Visual Studio solution and build an event-driven microservice to address a real-world problem. Attendees will learn how to design, develop, and deploy a decoupled, responsive, scalable, and independent solution. We will cover potential pitfalls and demonstrate strategies to overcome them.

By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of creating robust, event-driven microservices and be equipped with practical knowledge to apply to your projects.

## Short Abstract
Starting with an empty Visual Studio solution, during this session we will build an event-driven architected microservice solution to solve a real-world problem.
