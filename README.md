# File New: Build a Event-Driven Architected Microservice from Scratch

## Abstract
Event-driven microservice architectures provide a versatile approach to designing and integrating complex software systems with independent, encapsulated components.  During this session, we will focus on the how by starting with an empty Visual Studio solution and building a complete event-driven architected microservice to solve a real-world problem.  You will see firsthand how to design, develop, and deploy a decoupled, encapsulated, responsive, scalable, and independent solution.  Weâ€™ll talk about potential pitfalls, and you will see how to get around them.

## Short Abstract
Starting with an empty Visual Studio solution, during this session we will build an event-driven architected microservice solution to solve a real-world problem.
