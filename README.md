# Building an Event-Driven Microservice from Scratch

## Abstract
Event-driven microservice architectures offer a powerful method for designing and integrating complex software systems with independent, encapsulated components. This highly interactive session will start with an empty Visual Studio solution and build an event-driven microservice to address a real-world problem. Attendees will learn how to design, develop, and deploy a decoupled, responsive, scalable, and independent solution. We will cover potential pitfalls and demonstrate strategies to overcome them.

By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of creating robust, event-driven microservices and be equipped with practical knowledge to apply to your projects.

## Short Abstract
Starting with an empty Visual Studio solution, during this session we will build an event-driven architected microservice solution to solve a real-world problem.

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of the “Building an Event-Driven Microservice from Scratch” presentation, it would be beneficial to have the following prerequisites:

- **Basic Programming Knowledge**: Proficiency in a programming language such as C#, Java, or Python, as the session involves hands-on coding.
Familiarity with Visual Studio: Experience using Visual Studio or a similar integrated development environment (IDE) will help you follow along with the practical aspects of the session.
- **Understanding of Microservices**: Basic knowledge of microservices architecture, including concepts like service decomposition, inter-service communication, and scalability.
- **Knowledge of Cloud Services**: Basic understanding of cloud services and deployment, as the session may cover deploying microservices to cloud platforms.
- **Interest in Software Architecture**: A keen interest in learning about software architecture and design patterns will make the session more engaging and beneficial.

These prerequisites will ensure you can fully engage with the material and apply the knowledge effectively in your projects. Are you excited about diving into event-driven microservices?
